However, as with any open forum, there is a potential for misuse, where users may pose insincere or deceptive questions.\n",

For this project, we will be using word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, to convert the text into dense vector representations that capture semantic relationships between words.\n",

        "4. Model Selection and Training: For this project, we will explore various NLP models suitable for insincere question classification, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer models like BERT. These models have shown promising results in NLP tasks and can capture complex patterns and dependencies in text data. We will select the most appropriate model based on its performance on the validation dataset and train it using the labeled training dataset.\n",
        "\n",
