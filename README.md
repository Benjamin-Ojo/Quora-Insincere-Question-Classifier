[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains the code and resources for the project on insincere question classification on Quora. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify and classify insincere or deceptive questions on the Quora platform.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Quora Insincere Questions Classification dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset consists of a large collection of questions from Quora, along with labels indicating whether each question is sincere or insincere. The dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our classification model.

### Dataset Columns Description
- `qid`: Unique question identifier
- `question_text`: Text of the question
- `target`: Binary label indicating whether the question is insincere (1) or sincere (0)

## Methodology
The project follows a supervised learning approach to tackle the problem of insincere question classification. It involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection and training, model evaluation, and fine-tuning. Various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques are explored to build an effective classification model.

### Approach
1. Data Preprocessing: Text data is preprocessed by tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stop words and punctuation. Techniques like stemming or lemmatization may be applied for further normalization.

2. Feature Extraction: The preprocessed text data is transformed into a numerical representation suitable for machine learning algorithms. Common methods for feature extraction in NLP, such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe), are considered.

3. Model Selection and Training: Different classification algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, and deep learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks or transformers), are explored. Models are trained and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning: Performance evaluation is conducted using techniques like cross-validation and holdout validation. Based on the results, the chosen model is fine-tuned by adjusting hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

5. Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is developed, deployment options are considered. This may involve integrating the model into an application or building an API for real-time classification of new questions.

## Repository Structure
